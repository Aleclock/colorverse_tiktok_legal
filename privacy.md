# Privacy Policy for Colorverse

1. Data Collection: This application does not collect, store, or share any personal user data. It functions solely as a local automation script to facilitate content uploading to TikTok.
2. Authentication: The application uses TikTok’s official OAuth2 protocol. User credentials (passwords) are never seen or stored by the application; only an encrypted access token is stored locally on the user's machine to authorize uploads.
3. Data Usage: No data is sold or transferred to third parties. All video processing happens locally on the user's device.
4. Changes: Any changes to this policy will be updated at this page.
